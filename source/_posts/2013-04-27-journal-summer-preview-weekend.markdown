## PDX.js

This month's [Portland JavaScript Admirers](http://pdxjs.com/) was at [Janrain](http://janrain.com/) (where I work) for the first time. 

### Ember.js, Meteor, and Angular

[Jesse Hallett](http://sitr.us/) talked about his experiences trying out [Ember](http://emberjs.com/), interspersed by comments comparing the Ember approach to [Meteor](http://meteor.com/)'s (from myself) or [Angular](http://angularjs.org/) (from [Luc Perkins](https://twitter.com/lucperkins)) revealing our current affiliations. 

My own response to Ember's aim of making a more or less direct port of the Rails framework experience to the client is to barf up in my mouth a little bit.

*TODO: some highlights of the comparison*

Later the group retired to Bailey's Taproom to sample the [draft selections](http://www.baileystaproom.com/?page_id=8) and discuss the finer points of the Bitcoin protocol. I've previously shied away from Bitcoin for several reasons (the environmental impact of mining, and the fadness of it) but talking with Jesse et al that the Bitcoin network is a natural experiment in decentralized trust networks, and given my interest in that topic I should try to understand it.
